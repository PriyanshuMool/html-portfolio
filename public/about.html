<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, I am Priyanshu Mool
  I am pursuing Bachelor of Technology from IIT (ISM) DHANBAD.
  I am interested in Theoretical Physics, Mathematics, Astronomy, Photography, Astrophysics.
  I like to read research papers in Physics and books by Physicists.
  Capturing moments in just one click, saving them and reliving them. One photo, many memories.
  I am very curious to know the physics behind everything, from the subatomic particles to the grand universe, from the brightest Quasars to the darkest part of the Universe.
  I always try to make sense of what I see and believe and wonder our place in the universe.</p>

<p>I am deeply motivated for learning about quantum computing, cloud computing and web development.</p>
